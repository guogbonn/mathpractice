    But on the other hand, the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. cannot be represented in the same manner by
factors, unless for that purpose we make use of unity, and represent 2, for instance, by 1 × 2. But the numbers
which are multiplied by 1 remaining the same, it is not proper to reckon unity as a factor.

All numbers, therefore, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. which cannot be represented by factors, are called
simple, or prime numbers; whereas others, as 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, etc. which may be represented

  <p>This shows that prime numbers cannot be divided by other numbers; and, on the other hand, that the simple
  factors of compound numbers are found most conveniently, and with the greatest certainty, by seeking the
  simple, or prime numbers, by which those compound numbers are divisible.

  <h3>Division</h3>

    <blockquote cite="http://">
      The number which is to be decompounded, or divided,
  is called the dividend; the number of equal parts sought is called the divisor; the magnitude of one of those
  parts, determined by the division, is called the quotient: thus, in the above example,
  <br> <br>
  12 is the dividend,<br>
  3 is the divisor, and <br>
  4 is the quotient.

    If the numerator, on the contrary, be greater than the denominator, the value of the fracti on is greater than

fraction 1/4
means that if we divide 1 into 4 equal parts, this will be the value of one of those parts;</p>

<blockquote cite="http://">
   From this manner of considering fractions, the expressions numerator and denominator are derived. For, as
in the preceding fraction 7
12
, the number under the line shows that 12 is the number of parts into which unity is
to be divided ; and as it may be said to denote, or name, the parts, it has not improperly been called the
denominator.
 Farther, as the upper number, namely 7, shows that, in order to have the value of the fraction, we must take, or
collect, 7 of those parts, and therefore may be said to reckon or number them, it has been thought proper to call
the number above the line the numerator

<p>Fraction defintion: If we break a number one into (denominator) equal parts we have (numerator number of them )</p>

<blockquote cite="http://">
  We can never therefore arrive completely at 0, or nothing, howev er great the denominator may be ; and,
consequently, as those fractions must always preserve a cer tain quantity, we may continue the series of
fractions in the 78 th article without interrup tion. This circumstance has in troduced the expression that the
denominator must be infinite, or infinitely great, in order that the fraction may be reduced to 0, or to nothing;
hence the word infinite in reality sig nifies here that we can never arrive at the end of the series of the above -
mentioned fraction

<h3>Chapter VIII – Of the Properties of Fractions</h3>

<p>Scaling a fraction a(1/2) still one - half</p>


<p>In order therefore to reduce a given fraction to its least terms, it is required to find a number, by which both
the numerator and denominator may be divided. Such a number is called a common divisor; ... no other common divisor can be found,
this shows that the fraction is already in its simplest form. </p>


<p>We will conclude the present, however, by remarking that all whole numbers may also be represented by
fractions.</p>

<h3>Chapter IX – Of the Addition and Subtraction of Fractions</h3>


<blockquote cite="http://">
  To this part of the subject belongs also the question, Of two proposed fractions which is the greater or the
  less? For, to resolve this, we have only to reduce the two fractions to the same denominator. Let us take, for
  example, the two fractions 2/3
  and 5/7
  ; when reduced to the same denominator, the first becomes 14/21
  , and the second
  15/21
  , where it is evident that the second, or 5/7
  , is the greater, and exceeds the former by 1/21
  .

<p>If you don't want to multiply to find the common denominator you can alway reduce then multiply. Also, finding the common denominator is a form of normalizing.</p>

<blockquote> This inquiry is necessary, before we proc eed to the multiplication of fractions by
fractions. It is evident, if we have to divide the fraction 2/3
by 2, that the result must be 1

; and that the quotient of
6/7
divided by 3 is 2/7
. The rule therefore is, to divide the numerator by the integer without changing the
denominator. Thus: </blockquote>


<p>\[\frac{6}{7 *3} = \frac{2}{7}\]</p>

<p>Another way to divide fractions I was not familiar with. We can get rid of the 6 by dividing by 3. Instead of multiplying the denominator through and then reducing. </p>


<blockquote cite="http://">
  If it were required, for example, to divide 3/4
by 2, we should change the fraction into 6/8
, and then
dividing the numerator by 2, we should immediately have
3/8
for the quotient sought.
</blockquote>


<p>dividing fractions</p>

<blockquote cite="http://">
  Hence the following rule : Multiply the numerator of the dividend by the denomina tor of the divisor, and the
denominator of the dividend by the numerator of the divisor; then the first product will be the numerator of the
quotient, and the second will be its denominator
</blockquote>

<p>When the divisor is less than one the quotient is larger than the dividend</p>

<p>Every number divided by itself is 1. A fraction divided by itself is 1</p>


<blockquote cite="http://">
  We have still to explain an expression which is frequently used. It may be asked, for example, what is the
half of 3/4? This means that we must multiply 3/4
by 1/2
</blockquote>


<p>What is half of x? Then multiply x by 1/2.</p>

<h3>Chapter XI – Of Square Numbers</h3>

<blockquote>The product of a number, when multiplied by itself, is called a square; and, for this reason, the number,
considered in relation to such a product, is called a square root. For example, when we multiply 12 by 12, the
product 144 is a square, of which the root is 12.  <br> <br>  The origin of this term is borrowed from geometry, which teaches us that the contents of a square are found by
multiplying its side by itself. </blockquote>


<blockquote cite="http://">
  Here it will be readily perceived that the series of square numbers thus arranged has a singular property;
namely, that if each of them be subtracted from that which immediately follows, the remainders always increase
by 2, and form this series: <br> <br>
3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, etc.
</blockquote>

<p>I did not know that.</p>


<blockquote cite="http://">
  When the square of a mixed number, or a number composed of an integer and a fraction, is required, we
have only to reduce it to a single fraction, and then take the square of that fraction. Let it be required, for
example, to find the square of 2 1/2
; we first express this mixed number by 5/2
,
</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://">
  Thus, when the root is composed of two or more factors, we multiply their squares together ; and,
reciprocally, if a square be composed of two, or more factors, of which each is a square, we have only to
multiply together the roots of those squares, to obtain the complete root of the square proposed. Thus, 2304 is
equal to 4 × 16 × 36, the square root of which is 2 × 4 × 6, or 48; and 48 is found to b e the true square
root of 2304 because 48 × 48 gives 2304.
</blockquote>

<p>This is intresting. Find the factors then find the roots.</p>

<h3>Chapter XII – Of Square Roots, and of Irrational Numbers resulting from them</h3>


<blockquote cite="http://">
  There is therefore a sort of numbers, which cannot be assigned by fractions, but which are nevertheless
determinate quantities; as, for instance, the square root of 12: and we call this new species of numbers,
irrational numbers. They occur whenever we endeavour to find the square root of a number which is not a
square; thus, 2 not being a perfect square, the square root of 2, or the number which multiplied by itself would
produce 2, is an irrational quantity. These numbers are also called surd quantities or incommensurables.
</blockquote>

<p>Irrational defintion incommensurables</p>


<blockquote cite="http://">
  √2 by √2 must necessarily produce 2
</blockquote>


<blockquote cite="http://">
  In division, if it were required, for example, to divide √𝑎 by √𝑏, we obtain √
𝑎
𝑏
; and, in this instance, the
irrationality may vanish in the quotient. Thus, h aving to divide √18 by √8, the quotient is √
18
/
8
, which is
reduced to √
9
/
4
, and consequently to 3/
2
because 9/
4
is the square of 3/
2
</blockquote>

<p>Didn't know about this</p>


<blockquote cite="http://">
  . It is easy also to multiply irrational numbers by ordinary numbers; thus, for example, 2 multiplied by √5
makes 2√5; and 3 times √2 makes 3√2. In the second example, h owever, as 3 is equal to √9, we may also
express 3 times √2 by √9 multiplied by √2, or by √18; <br> also 2√𝑎 is the same as √4𝑎, and 3√𝑎 the same as √9𝑎;
and, <span class="yellow"> in general, b√𝑎 has the same value as the square root of 𝑏𝑏𝑎, or √𝑏𝑏𝑎 </span>:  we can infer reciprocally that
when the number which is preceded by    <span class="yellow">the radical sign contains a square, we may take the root of that square,
and put it before the sign,as we should do in writing b√𝑎 instead of √𝑏𝑏𝑎,  </span>  After this, the following reductions
will be easily understood
</blockquote>

<p>This was not explained well in school. Thankful for this!</p>

<blockquote cite="http://">
  We may observe, lastly, that in order to distinguish the irrational numbers, we call all other numbers, both
integral and fractional, rational numbers; so that, whenever we speak of rational numbers, we understand
integers, or fractions.

<h3>Chapter XIII – Of Impossible, or Imaginary Quantities, which arise from the same
source</h3>

<blockquote cite="http://">
  When it is required, therefore, to extract the root of a negative number, a great difficulty arises; since there
is no assignable number, the square of which would be a negative quantity. Suppose, for example, that we
wished to extract the root of − 4; we here require such a number as, when multiplied by itself, would produce
−4: now, this number is neither + 2 nor − 2 because the square both of + 2 and of − 2, is + 4, and not − 4.
</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://">
  All such expressions, as √−1, √−2, √−3, √−4, etc. are consequently impossible, or imaginary numbers,
since they represent roots of negative quantities; and of such numbers we may truly assert that they are neither
nothing, nor greater than nothing, no r less than n othing; which necessarily constitutes them imaginary, or
impossible
</blockquote>

<p>imaginary numbers</p>

<blockquote cite="http://">
  . Now, as − 𝑎 is equal to + 𝑎 multiplied by − 1, and as the square root of a product is found by multiplying
together the roots of its factors, it follows that the root of 𝑎 times − 1, or √−𝑎, is equal to √𝑎 multiplied by
√−1; but √𝑎 is a possible or real number, consequently the whole impossibility of an imaginar y quantity may  
Leonard Euler 51
be always reduced to √−1; for this reason, √−4 is equal to √4 multiplied by √−1, or equal to 2 √−1 because
√4 is equal to 2; likewise √−9 is reduced to √9 × √−1, or 3√−1; and √−16 is equal to 4√−1
</blockquote>

<p>the crux of imaginary numbers is √−1</p>

<h3>Chapter XIV – Of Cubic Numbers</h3>

<blockquote cite="http://">
  When a number has been multiplied twice by itself, or, which is the same thing, when the square of a
number has been multiplied once more by that number, we obtain a product which is called a cube or a cubic
number. Thus, the cube of 𝑎 is 𝑎𝑎𝑎, since it is the product obtained by multiplying 𝑎 by itself, or by 𝑎, and that
square 𝑎𝑎 again by 𝑎. <br> <br>
 The cubes of the natural numbers, therefore, succeed each other in the following order[14]:
<br> <br>
Numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <br>
Cubes 1 8 27 64 125 216 343 512 729 1000 <br>

<br> <br>
 If we consider the differences of those cubes, as we did of the squares, by subtracting each cube from that
which comes after it, we obtain the following series of numbers: <br> <br>
7, 19, 37, 61, 91, 127, 169, 217, 271. <br> <br>
Where we do not at first observe any regularity in them ; but if we take the respective differences of these
numbers, we find the following series: <br> <br>
12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60;<br> <br>
in which the terms, it is evident, increase always by 6.
</blockquote>

<p>When we took the differnce of the series on the squared number (derivative/ velocity) we noticed a pattern. Now on cube we have to take the second difference (acceleration) and we notice a pattern. If I apply the same to the degrees count in increase in Going back to harmonic series </p>

<p>Same as squares no imginary nums</p>
<h3>Chapter XVI – Of Powers in general</h3>

<blockquote cite="http://">
  The product which we obtain by multiplying a number once, or several times by itself, is called a power.
Thus, a square which arises from the multiplication of a number by itself, and a cube which we obtain by
multiplying a number twice by itself, are powers. We say also, in the former case, that the number is raised to
the second degree, or to the second power; and in the latter, that the number is raised to the third degree, or to
the third power

by one-time, or term, than the preceding.
</blockquote>

<p>Reducing the power </p>

<blockquote cite="http://">
  As in this series of powers each term is found by multiplying the preceding term by 𝑎, which increases the
exponent by 1; so when any term is given, we may also find the preceding term, if we divide by 𝑎, because this
diminishes the exponent by 1. This shows that the term which precedes the first term 𝑎

done by multiplication. When we seek, for example, the square, or the second power of 𝑎

; and in
the same manner we find 𝑎
12 for the third power or the cube, of 𝑎

only to double its exponent; for its cube, we must triple the exponent; and so on. Thus, the square of 𝑎

It would be much more effienct to find our desired value. Continuing,  Doex 10^(x) = 2 where x = 2/7 actually equal 2? To solve,  times both sides by ^7/1. This raises 10^2/7 to the power of 7 getting rid of 7 in the denominator. So, 100 = 2^7  -> 100 = 128 therefore, 2/7 is less than the desired value because the left side of the equation is less than the right. If the otherside of the equation was greater then we would have overshot and the next value we would try would be less than 2/7.

So reciprocally, we know at the first sight of the in teger part of a logarithm, how many figures compose
the number answering to that logarithm; since the number of those figures always exceed the integer part of the
logarithm by unity. Suppose, for example, the numb er answering to the logarithm 6.4771213 were required,
we know immediately that that number must have seven figures, and be greater than 1000000. And in fact this
number is 3000000; for 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 3000000 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 3 + 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 1000000. Now 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 3 = 0.4771213, and

the point, and even that, when once known, serves for several numbers. In order to prove this, let us con sider
the logarithm of the number 365; its first part is undoubtedly 2; with respect to the other, or the decimal
fraction, let us at present represent it by the letter 𝑥; we shall have 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 365 = 2 + 𝑥; then multiplying
continually by 10, we shall have 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 3650 = 3 + 𝑥; 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 36500 = 4 + 𝑥; 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 365000 = 5 + 𝑥, and so
on.
 But we can also go back, and continually divide by 10; which will give us 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 36.5 = 1 + 𝑥; 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 3.65 =
0 + 𝑥; 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 0.365 = – 1 + 𝑥; 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 0.0365 = – 2 + 𝑥; 𝑙𝑜𝑔. 0.00365 = – 3 + 𝑥, and so on.

required to take the quadruple of 𝐴: for if we first take a seven times, it will then be necessary to subtract 3𝐴
from that product. <br> <br>
 In general, therefore, if it be required to multiply 𝐴 by 𝑑 − 𝑒, we multiply the quantity 𝐴 first by 𝑑, and then
by 𝑒, and subtract this last product from the first: whence results 𝑑𝐴 − 𝑒𝐴. <br><br>

be found = 2500 + 700 + 49 = 3249.

2 + 2𝑎 + 1: for since the square of 𝑎 is 𝑎
2

the square of 𝑎 + 1 by adding to that square 2𝑎 + 1; and it must be observed that this 2𝑎 + 1 is the sum of
the two roots 𝑎, and 𝑎 + 1.

, to see if we can derive from it the second part of the root, which is 𝑏. Now, this remainder,
2𝑎𝑏 + 𝑏
2
, may be represen ted by the product, (2𝑎 + 𝑏)𝑏; wherefore the remainder having two factors,
(2𝑎 + 𝑏), and 𝑏, it is evident that we shall find the latter, 𝑏, which is the second part of the root, by dividing
the remainder, 2𝑎𝑏 + 𝑏
2
, by 2𝑎 + 𝑏. <br>
320. So that the quotient, arising from the division of the above remainder by 2𝑎 + 𝑏, is the second term of the
root required; and in this division we observe that 2𝑎 is the double of the first term 𝑎, which is already
determined: so that although the second term is ye t unknown, and it is necessary, for the present, to leave its
place empty, we may nevertheless attempt the division, since in it we attend only to the first term 2𝑎; but as
soon as the quotient is found, which in the present case is 𝑏, we must put it in the vacant place, and thus render
the division complete

0 because these two terms destroy one another. Thus, the quantities 3 + √2 and 1 + √2, added together, make
4 + 2√2, or 4 + √8; the sum of 5 + √3 and 4 − √3, is 9; and that of 2√3 + 3√2 and √3 − √2, is 3√3 + 2√2.

  334. So that whenever a root is composed of two terms, it is easy to find its cube by this rule: for example, the
number 5 = 3 + 2; its cube is therefore 27 + 8 + (18 × 5) = 125.
 And if 7 + 3 = 10 be the root; then the cube will be 343 + 27 + (63 × 10) = 1000.
 To find the cube of 36, let us suppose the root 36 = 30 + 6, and we have for the cube required, 27000 +
